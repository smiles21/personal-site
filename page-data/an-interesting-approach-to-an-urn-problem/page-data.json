Continue making moves as long as there are two or\nmore pebbles in the urn, where a move is defined as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take two pebbles out of the urn</li>\n<li>If their colors are the same, put a black pebble in the urn.  If their colors\nare different, put a white pebble in the urn.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given the above, what can be said about the color of the final pebble in the\nurn?</p>\n<p>As I had tried myself, all of my colleagues approached the problem using a case\nanalysis of the last few pebbles.  This method quickly gets out of hand\ndetermining how the urn could even have reached a combination of just three\npebbles.</p>\n<p>After a small hint, I was able to see the argument.  I liked the beauty of the\nanswer and it opened my eyes to a different way to approach problems.</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Completion:</em></p>\n<p>The game will complete with only one pebble in the urn, since in every move we\nremove two pebbles and place one in.  This move results in one less pebble being\nin the urn at the end of the turn.  If we have only one pebble, we are done, and\nif we have more than one pebble, this process will eventually leave only one\npebble in the urn.</p>\n<!-- We shall show this while ignoring the color of the pebbles in the urn.\n\nLet $K = B + W$, where $K$ is the initial number of pebbles, $B$ is the initial number of\nblack pebbles, and $W$ is the initial number of white pebbles.  At the\nbeginning of the game, let $k := K$.  We are guaranteed that $k /geq 1$ by the\nprecondition of the game.  As a move goes on, we remove two pebbles\n($k := k - 2$) and add back one pebble ($k := k + 1$), with a net result being\nto remove one pebble ($k := k - 1$) -->\n<p><em>Correctness:</em></p>\n<p>To see which color will remain at the end of the game, we shall examine the\nchange in number of each color.  Suppose at the beginning of an arbitrary turn,\nthere are $b$ black pebbles and $w$ white pebbles in the urn.  Examining the\npossible cases of the moves where $B$ signifies a black pebble pulled from the\nurn and $W$ a white pebble pulled from the urn, we see:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Assuming $b \\geq 1 \\wedge w \\geq 1$, ${BW \\rightarrow W} \\Rightarrow b := b - 1$</li>\n<li>Assuming $b \\geq 2$, ${BB \\rightarrow B} \\Rightarrow b := b - 1$</li>\n<li>Assuming $w \\geq 2$,  ${WW \\rightarrow B} \\Rightarrow b := b + 1 ; w := w - 2$</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If we observe the parity of $w$, we notice that it will never change, since $w$\nonly ever changes by 2.  Taking this a step further, we can say that the parity\nof $w$ will never change as the game is played.</p>\n<p>Given that we play this game until we only have one pebble, we can safely say\nthat the last pebble’s color can be determined by the number of white\npebbles in the urn at the beginning of the game.  If that number is even, the\nlast pebble will be black, and if that number is odd, the last pebble will be\nwhite.</p>\n<p><strong>End of Answer</strong></p>\n<p>Now I very much like this answer for a number of reason.  Firstly, I was\npleased when I saw it first because of the interesting way it seems to throw\nout how my colleagues and I initially tried to solve it.  By ignoring how we\ngot to any specific instance in the chain of moves, we can eventually see that\nthe chain of moves hardly ever mattered.  The only thing that actually mattered\nwas the initial number of white pebbles.</p>\n<p>Secondly, I enjoy this answer because it is extremely easy to explain to a\nlayman.  Anyone with a very basic background in math or who can think critically\ncan wrap their heads around such an easy game, and likewise a answer that\nrevolves around if a number is even.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"[0]: An Interesting Approach to An Urn Problem","date":"April 28, 2019","description":"An urn problem with an easy to explain answer"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/an-interesting-approach-to-an-urn-problem/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/data-creation-and-context/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"[1]: Data Creation and Context"}}}}}
