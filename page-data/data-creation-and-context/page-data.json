His\nstatement basically boiled down to the idea that data does not inherently exist\nin nature, but must be created at some time, otherwise it is lost forever.  I\nfound this observation rather interesting, and wanted to travel a bit further\ndown the rabbit hole into the concept of data and its usefulness.</p>\n<p>Following from data needing to be created, we can see something rather\ninteresting: data is inherently human-made.  In order to create data, some\nobservation needs to be made about an idea or entity, and a number or label\nassigned to it.  These observations may be a pressure reading from a meter, the\ntemperature outside, or the color of the spots on a bee.  Let’s examine both\nqualifiable data points, such as the bee’s spots, and quantifiable data points,\nsuch as the pressure and temperature.</p>\n<p>The qualifiable data points can be more easily shown to be human-made since the\nlabel of the data point itself is defined somehow by humans.  In our example of\nthe color of spots on a bee, the color of the spots exists in the natural world,\nbut the color yellow is created by a human and has become generally accepted to\nmean the wavelengths of light reaching our eyes from the bee.  Thus we can see\nthat qualifiable data is human-made.</p>\n<p>Quantifiable data points use a similar argument, but we have to look at them\nmore closely. At least two parts are required to create a quantifiable data\npoint: a number and a unit of measure. While it is still a debate of whether\nnumbers themselves are natural or created by humans, we can definitively say\nthat a unit of measure is human-made.  To say that it is 37 degrees Celsius\noutside and understand what that means, we first need to define what a degree\nCelsius is.  If we leave off the unit of measure, we are merely left with a\nnumber by itself.</p>\n<p>Back out of the philosophical world, where does just a number get us, though? In\nthe real world of utilizing this data, not very far. If given the number 37 and\nasked if I need to wear long pants or shorts when I go outside, I would have no\nclue how to answer.  While a ridiculous idea on Earth, suppose it was 37 Kelvin\noutside.  The decision of pants or shorts wouldn’t really matter much at all in\nsuch a situation.  Thus, we can’t remove the unit of measure from the data point\nand still have a useful data point.</p>\n<p>Continuing further in the real world, let’s look at the usefulness of the data\nwe create.  By itself, data doesn’t really serve much purpose.  We must combine\nit with other context for it to really give us any understanding of what we are\nobserving.  Telling someone who has lived their whole life in a\nclimate-controlled room at 22 degree Celsius that is 37 degrees Celsius outside\nwill not give them any clarity to how warm it actually is outside.  They would\nneed more context to truly understand what that means; be it direct, such as\ntheir room being heated to that temperature, or indirect, where they perhaps\nknow what a five-degree Celsius change feels like and can extrapolate the\n15-degree difference. </p>\n<p>Especially in the modern world, data has become more and more widespread and\nprecious.  While we should respect and study how data has shaped our lives and\naided our decision-making processes, we should still view data as a human-made\nconstruct which must be captured when possible, else it is gone forever.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"[1]: Data Creation and Context","date":"June 27, 2019","description":"On the nature of data and what makes it useful"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/data-creation-and-context/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/an-interesting-approach-to-an-urn-problem/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"[0]: An Interesting Approach to An Urn Problem"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/multiplying-2digit-numbers-by-eleven/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"[2]: Multiplying 2-digit Numbers By 11"}}}}}
