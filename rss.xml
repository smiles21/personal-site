importance of data and one line stuck out to me as being interesting.  His
statement basically boiled down to the idea that data does not inherently exist
in nature, but must be created at some time, otherwise it is lost forever.  I
found this observation rather interesting, and wanted to travel a bit further
down the rabbit hole into the concept of data and its usefulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following from data needing to be created, we can see something rather
interesting: data is inherently human-made.  In order to create data, some
observation needs to be made about an idea or entity, and a number or label
assigned to it.  These observations may be a pressure reading from a meter, the
temperature outside, or the color of the spots on a bee.  Let’s examine both
qualifiable data points, such as the bee’s spots, and quantifiable data points,
such as the pressure and temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The qualifiable data points can be more easily shown to be human-made since the
label of the data point itself is defined somehow by humans.  In our example of
the color of spots on a bee, the color of the spots exists in the natural world,
but the color yellow is created by a human and has become generally accepted to
mean the wavelengths of light reaching our eyes from the bee.  Thus we can see
that qualifiable data is human-made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quantifiable data points use a similar argument, but we have to look at them
more closely. At least two parts are required to create a quantifiable data
point: a number and a unit of measure. While it is still a debate of whether
numbers themselves are natural or created by humans, we can definitively say
that a unit of measure is human-made.  To say that it is 37 degrees Celsius
outside and understand what that means, we first need to define what a degree
Celsius is.  If we leave off the unit of measure, we are merely left with a
number by itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back out of the philosophical world, where does just a number get us, though? In
the real world of utilizing this data, not very far. If given the number 37 and
asked if I need to wear long pants or shorts when I go outside, I would have no
clue how to answer.  While a ridiculous idea on Earth, suppose it was 37 Kelvin
outside.  The decision of pants or shorts wouldn’t really matter much at all in
such a situation.  Thus, we can’t remove the unit of measure from the data point
and still have a useful data point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuing further in the real world, let’s look at the usefulness of the data
we create.  By itself, data doesn’t really serve much purpose.  We must combine
it with other context for it to really give us any understanding of what we are
observing.  Telling someone who has lived their whole life in a
climate-controlled room at 22 degree Celsius that is 37 degrees Celsius outside
will not give them any clarity to how warm it actually is outside.  They would
need more context to truly understand what that means; be it direct, such as
their room being heated to that temperature, or indirect, where they perhaps
know what a five-degree Celsius change feels like and can extrapolate the
15-degree difference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially in the modern world, data has become more and more widespread and
precious.  While we should respect and study how data has shaped our lives and
aided our decision-making processes, we should still view data as a human-made
construct which must be captured when possible, else it is gone forever.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[[0]: An Interesting Approach to An Urn Problem]]></title><description><![CDATA[I found myself watching a lecture by Edsger Dijkstra a few days back and saw an

interesting problem which I posed to some colleagues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose an urn with one or more pebbles, each pebble being black or white, and
the following simple game.  Continue making moves as long as there are two or
more pebbles in the urn, where a move is defined as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take two pebbles out of the urn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If their colors are the same, put a black pebble in the urn.  If their colors
are different, put a white pebble in the urn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the above, what can be said about the color of the final pebble in the
urn?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I had tried myself, all of my colleagues approached the problem using a case
analysis of the last few pebbles.  This method quickly gets out of hand
determining how the urn could even have reached a combination of just three
pebbles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a small hint, I was able to see the argument.  I liked the beauty of the
answer and it opened my eyes to a different way to approach problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Completion:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game will complete with only one pebble in the urn, since in every move we
remove two pebbles and place one in.  This move results in one less pebble being
in the urn at the end of the turn.  If we have only one pebble, we are done, and
if we have more than one pebble, this process will eventually leave only one
pebble in the urn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- We shall show this while ignoring the color of the pebbles in the urn.

Let $K = B + W$, where $K$ is the initial number of pebbles, $B$ is the initial number of
black pebbles, and $W$ is the initial number of white pebbles.  At the
beginning of the game, let $k := K$.  We are guaranteed that $k /geq 1$ by the
precondition of the game.  As a move goes on, we remove two pebbles
($k := k - 2$) and add back one pebble ($k := k + 1$), with a net result being
to remove one pebble ($k := k - 1$) --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correctness:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see which color will remain at the end of the game, we shall examine the
change in number of each color.  Suppose at the beginning of an arbitrary turn,
there are $b$ black pebbles and $w$ white pebbles in the urn.  Examining the
possible cases of the moves where $B$ signifies a black pebble pulled from the
urn and $W$ a white pebble pulled from the urn, we see:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assuming $b \geq 1 \wedge w \geq 1$, ${BW \rightarrow W} \Rightarrow b := b - 1$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assuming $b \geq 2$, ${BB \rightarrow B} \Rightarrow b := b - 1$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assuming $w \geq 2$,  ${WW \rightarrow B} \Rightarrow b := b + 1 ; w := w - 2$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we observe the parity of $w$, we notice that it will never change, since $w$
only ever changes by 2.  Taking this a step further, we can say that the parity
of $w$ will never change as the game is played.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that we play this game until we only have one pebble, we can safely say
that the last pebble’s color can be determined by the number of white
pebbles in the urn at the beginning of the game.  If that number is even, the
last pebble will be black, and if that number is odd, the last pebble will be
white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End of Answer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I very much like this answer for a number of reason.  Firstly, I was
pleased when I saw it first because of the interesting way it seems to throw
out how my colleagues and I initially tried to solve it.  By ignoring how we
got to any specific instance in the chain of moves, we can eventually see that
the chain of moves hardly ever mattered.  The only thing that actually mattered
was the initial number of white pebbles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, I enjoy this answer because it is extremely easy to explain to a
layman.  Anyone with a very basic background in math or who can think critically
can wrap their heads around such an easy game, and likewise a answer that
revolves around if a number is even.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
